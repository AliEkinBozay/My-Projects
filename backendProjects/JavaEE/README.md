Hospital Appointment System

This project was developed during my summer internship, where I collaborated with two other interns to create a hospital appointment system. Although my primary focus was on the backend and database components, I contributed to all aspects of the project.

The system was built using Java for the backend, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. SQL was used to manage and interact with the database. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in full-stack development while working in a team environment.
