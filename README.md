# My-Projects
These are the projects I've worked on to enhance my skills in web and mobile application development. They have provided hands-on experience with both backend and frontend technologies, as well as mobile app frameworks. Through these projects, Iâ€™ve honed my technical abilities and gained practical knowledge in creating user-friendly, responsive, and functional applications.
